# DataMath

This library is inspired by shader programming languages. Several similar types are implemented, float4, float3 etc. Supports converting to Unity base types, such as float3 to Vector3. Also provides a set of mathematical functions and random number generators.
Developed as an extension to DragonECS project, to simplify writing engine-independent systems.
