### Library of new data types with mathematics for C# and DragonECS
> WARNING: The API is a work in progress! Some features may not be implemented and the API may change in the future

This library is inspired by shader programming languages. Several similar types are implemented, `float4`, `float3` etc. Supports converting to Unity base types, such as `float3` to `Vector3`. But can be applied outside of Unity. Also provides a set of mathematical functions ~~and random number generators~~.

**Developed as an extension to DragonECS project, to simplify writing engine-independent systems.**
> DragonECS is currently unavailable

implemented types
`double2`, `double3`, `double4`, `float2`, `float3`, `float4`, `int2`, `int3`, `int4`, `uint2`, `uint3`, `uint4`, etc.
