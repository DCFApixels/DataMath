### Library of new data types with mathematics for C# and DragonECS

This library is inspired by shader programming languages. Several similar types are implemented, `float4`, `float3` etc. Supports converting to Unity base types, such as `float3` to `Vector3`. But can be applied outside of Unity. Also provides a set of mathematical functions and random number generators.

**Developed as an extension to DragonECS project, to simplify writing engine-independent systems.**
